        <h1>Application</h1>
        <h2>Layer 7</h2>
        <p>This is the layer of the osi model that we as users actually communicate/ interact with. The application
          layer acts as a sort of middle man helping applications such as edge or chrome interact with the other layers
          of the osi. On top of this task the application layer also has to establish and identify the availability of
          the other devices that you are trying to communicate with and to determine if there are enough resources for
          the communication request to exist </p>

        <h1>Presentation</h1>
        <h2>Layer 6</h2>

        <p>the presentation layer does exactly what it is named for it presents the data to the application layer. On
          top of this the presentation layer is responsible for other things such as data translation, code formatting,
          data compression/decompression, and data encryption/decryption. To successfully transfer data to another
          device first the data will be translated to a generic version then when the info is received it will be
          translated out of the generic version into however that device reads the data </p>

        <h1>Session</h1>
        <h2>Layer 5</h2>
        <p>This is the layer od the osi model that is responsible for creating, maintaining and tearing down sessions
          between the presentation layer entities. This layer is what keeps applications data separate and keeps them
          from messing each other up. example being this layer allows you to have multiple web browsers going without
          them clashing with each other </p>

        <h1>Transport</h1>
        <h2>Layer 4</h2>

        <p>This layer is responsible for segmenting and reassembling data into get this a data stream. This layer has a
          big hand in helping the information (data from upper layers unite and work together on the same data stream.
          The transport layer is also what provides the ability for the upper layers to multiplex (it just means being
          able to run more then one application at once), establish virtual connections, and breaking down virtual
          circuits. Also id be remised if I didn’t mention the fact the transport layer can either connectionless or
          connection oriented </p>

        <h1>Network</h1>
        <h2>Layer 3</h2>
        <p>This layer’s job is managing logical device addressing, it tracks the locations of each device that is om a
          network, and determines what the best way to move data. The network layer like you may guess from the name
          must transport traffic to devices that are not local, a router for your wifi being a good example. First the
          network looks for the ip address to send the traffic and if it doesn’t have a particular one already set the
          router will go through its address routing table to look for a destination to send the info. If a destination
          can not be found though the router drops the traffic. Lastly, I won’t go into much detail but there are two
          types of packets used on this layer. First are <b>data packs</b> these transport data through the
          internetwork, and <b>route-update</b> packets these are used to update neighboring routers about all the
          networks connected </p>

        <h1>Data Link</h1>
        <h2>Layer 2</h2>

        <p>This layer is responsible for the physical transmission of the data, error notifications, topology, and ever
          important flow control. The data layer ensures that messages are delivered to the proper device on a local
          area network using a mac (media access control) addresses and translates the network layers messages into bits
          for the physical layer to transmit. The data link layer formats the message into pieces called data frames and
          adds a header that contains the data destination. This extra info is bit by bit discarded by the data as it
          travels and is no longer useful until it finally reaches its location having shed its unneeded data. The data
          is never actually altered along this journey only extra things will be added and then stripped from it as
          travels until it arrives the same as when it was sent.</p>

        <h1>Physical</h1>
        <h2>Layer 1</h2>
        <p>Now this is the final layer of the osi model and it has a (or rather two) very important job(s) to send bits
          and to receive bits. These bits are just in values of ones and zeros. These bits can be represented
          differently by different types of media like using audio tones or changes in voltage back and forth. Specific
          protocols are needed for each type to describe the proper bit patterns needed. The connectors and physical
          topologies are defined by standards allowing different systems to communicate. Finally the physical layer also
          defines how the physical topology of a network is laid out </p>
